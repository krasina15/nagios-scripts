* check_graphite - Ruby script to check values from Graphite API.
* check_mem - Perl script Copyright (C) 2000 by Dan Larsson <dl@tyfon.net> with modifications by Justin Ellison <justin@techadvise.com>. I made minor changes to the performance data output.
* check_mounts - Perl script to analyze mounts. Inspired by Dean Wilson's http://www.unixdaemon.net/code/check_mounted_disks.pl version but rewritten to use proc for more accurate results.
